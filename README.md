        Flashback to 1974: Porur was a little-known village in the outskirts of the erstwhile Madras. Yet to be upgraded to town Panchayat, the hamlet lacked even proper roads. This was the time PV Janardhanan nurtured and materialised his dream of starting a cinema. It all began with a touring talkies called Gopalakrishna Theatre. With a cherished ambition to make it big in the show business, he later went to build a theatre and it took almost two years to finish the work.
